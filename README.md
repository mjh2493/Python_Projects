# Python_Projects

These are basic projects written in Python. They include the use of tkinter, sqlite, and django. 

## Projects:
- [Phonebook](https://github.com/mjh2493/Python_Projects/tree/main/Phonebook_Project)
- [Check Files GUI](https://github.com/mjh2493/Python_Projects/blob/main/file_transfer.py)
- [Django Checkbook](https://github.com/mjh2493/Python_Projects/tree/main/Checkbook/Django_Checkbook)


## Phonebook
This project functions as a phone book for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entires. 

## Check Files GUI
This project allows the user to choose to transfer all .txt files from one chosen directory to another. All files that are moved will be saved in a database. 

## Django Checkbook
Given some static and template files, I applied my knowledge of Django and Python to make the app fully functional.
